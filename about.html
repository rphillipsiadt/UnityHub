                    UnityHub is an educational app designed for people that are unable to attend higher education in Ireland for various reasons.
                    UnityHub was a project designed and created by four college Students. Jeremi Olczak was the lead designer. The other three members; RÃ­an Phillips, Kieron Temuku and Adarsh Pandey.
                    <br><br>
                    We wanted to create an app to help with the Quality Education Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). We decided that we wanted our target audience to be those that are unable to attend 
                    for variouse reasons. For example, some refugees would not be able to attend college or people who might have dropped out of secondary school.
                    <br><br>
                    We research other educational apps, to ensure that our idea did not already exist. We also used apps such as Duolingo and LinkedIn as inspiration for our own application.
                    We also used these other apps for inspiration for the design of our application.
                    <br><br>
                    UnityHub is a passion project for the four of us and we are very thankful that all of our users are enjoying our app and giving us great feedback.
